# 2024 ACM Programming Contest

Welcome!

Please pay attention to PC^2 and verbal announcements for clarifications on rules and problems!

* **Only one computer may be used per team.**
* Complete as many questions as you can during the contest. 
* No connection to the Internet may be made during the contest. (outside of minimal access to this repo) 
* All questions require you to read the test data from standard input and write results to standard output; you cannot use any non-contest files for input or output. 
* The input to problems will consist of multiple test cases unless otherwise noted. 
* Programming style is not considered in this contest. You are free to code in whatever style you prefer.  Commenting code is not required. 
* All communication with the judges will be handled by the PC2 environment. 
* Allowed programming languages: C, C++, Java, and Python. 
* **Java users: remember to call `nextLine()` on a scanner after reading in an integer when needed.**
* All programs will be re-compiled prior to testing with the judges’ data. 
* Output must match the sample format exactly. Do not print prompts unless asked to. 
* Non-standard libraries cannot be used in your solutions. The Standard Template Library (STL) and string libraries are allowed. The standard Java API is available and can be used, except for those packages that are deemed dangerous by contest officials (e.g., that might generate a security violation) 
* Hardcopy reference materials are allowed, but no electronic material. Calculators are fine, but no laptops, phones, USB drives, etc. are allowed.  

Judges decisions are to be considered final. No cheating will be tolerated.
